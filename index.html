<h2>About Me</h2>


<div class="container"> 
    <p>
       I'm the kind of person who walks into a room and quietly notices the little things others miss, like a plant that needs water or a joke waiting to be made. I balance curiosity with a laid-back vibe, always ready to try something new but never rushing into anything without a moment of thought. People find it easy to talk to me because I listen with genuine interest, and even though I don’t always show it. Whether exploring a new hobby, getting lost in music, or just chilling with my own thoughts, I carry a mix of calm confidence and quiet determination that makes my presence feel steady and real.

               Project Mayhem represents the moment when Fight Club evolves from an underground space for release into a full-scale rebellion against modern consumer culture. What starts as a personal search for identity turns into a militarized, disciplined group that rejects all forms of societal control. The members shave their heads, give up their names, and surrender their individuality to the collective mission, believing destruction is the only path to freedom. Through Project Mayhem, the film explores how easily people can be drawn into extremist ideas when they feel powerless or invisible, and how revolutions can become dangerous when the original purpose gets lost in chaos. It’s a powerful reflection on identity, conformity, and how the desire to break the system can sometimes destroy the self

               The story of Fight Club centers on an unnamed man who, suffering from insomnia and feeling alienated by modern consumer culture, meets a charismatic soap maker named Tyler Durden. He forms a secret fight club with Durden as a way to feel alive and reconnect with a more primal sense of self. As the club grows and transforms into a radical anti-consumerist organization called Project Mayhem, the narrator's reality unravels, and he discovers that Tyler Durden is a projection of his own fractured psyche.
